## Introduction

Whether you're a producer reviewing submissions, a development executive evaluating projects, or a reader working through a stack of scripts, the ability to efficiently process screenplays is an invaluable skill.

The average screenplay is 90-120 pages long. When you're dealing with dozens—or even hundreds—of scripts, you need a systematic approach to evaluate them quickly without missing quality material.

## The Pre-Read Phase

### Organizing Your Script Queue

Before diving into reading, set up a system:

1. **Categorize by priority**: Requested material, agent submissions, and unsolicited scripts
2. **Track deadlines**: Some scripts need immediate attention
3. **Note context**: Who submitted it, any recommendations, genre considerations
4. **Create a tracking spreadsheet**: Title, source, date received, status

### The 10-Page Test

Industry professionals often use the "10-page rule"—if a script hasn't grabbed you in the first 10 pages, it likely won't improve. During these pages, look for:

- A compelling opening image or scene
- Clear establishment of tone and genre
- An intriguing protagonist or situation
- Professional formatting and clean prose
- A voice that feels fresh and confident

## Speed Reading Techniques

### Skimming vs. Deep Reading

Not every script deserves a full, careful read on the first pass. Learn to:

- Skim action lines while focusing on dialogue
- Jump to major structural points (inciting incident, midpoint, climax)
- Read sample scenes from different parts of the script
- Note pacing through page density (more white space = faster read)

### What to Focus On

When speed reading, prioritize:

- **Character introductions**: How are main characters described?
- **Dialogue quality**: Does it feel authentic and distinctive?
- **Structure**: Does the script hit its beats at the right times?
- **Conflict escalation**: Does each act raise the stakes?

## Using Technology

### Script Analysis Software

Modern tools can help you process scripts faster:

- **Final Draft and WriterSolo**: For professional formatting review
- **Script coverage software**: Automated initial analysis
- **Read-aloud tools**: Listen to scripts while doing other tasks
- **Highlighting and annotation tools**: Digital markup for notes

### Creating Templates

Develop coverage templates that you can fill out quickly:

```
SCRIPT COVERAGE TEMPLATE
========================
Title:
Writer:
Genre:
Pages:
Date Read:

LOGLINE: (One sentence summary)

SYNOPSIS: (Half page max)

STRENGTHS:
-
-
-

WEAKNESSES:

COMPARABLE TITLES:

RECOMMENDATION: [ ] PASS [ ] CONSIDER [ ] RECOMMEND
```

## Evaluation Frameworks

### The Story Spine

Quickly evaluate narrative structure using the "story spine":

> Once upon a time...
> Every day...
> But one day...
> Because of that...
> Because of that...
> Until finally...
> And ever since then...

Can you fill this in after reading? If not, the structure may be unclear.

### Character Checklist

For each main character, ask:

- Do they have a clear goal?
- What's at stake if they fail?
- What's their flaw or wound?
- Do they change by the end?
- Are they active or passive in pursuing their goal?

## Common Red Flags

Learn to spot issues quickly:

- **Page one problems**: Camera directions, excessive description, "we see" language
- **Dialogue issues**: On-the-nose exposition, all characters sound the same
- **Structural problems**: Inciting incident after page 25, saggy second act
- **Concept issues**: Unclear genre, derivative premise, unmarketable idea
- **Formatting errors**: Incorrect margins, missing scene headings, wrong font

## Building Your Reading Muscle

### Practice and Calibration

The more scripts you read, the faster you get. Aim to:

- Read at least 5-10 scripts per week
- Compare your coverage to professional coverage when available
- Discuss scripts with other readers to calibrate your taste
- Track which scripts you recommended that got made

### Taking Care of Yourself

Script reading is mentally demanding. To stay sharp:

- Take regular breaks
- Read in your peak productivity hours
- Vary your reading environment
- Balance script reading with pleasure reading

## Conclusion

Processing scripts efficiently is a skill that develops over time. By combining systematic organization, strategic reading techniques, and the right tools, you can evaluate more material without sacrificing quality.

Remember: the goal isn't just to read faster—it's to find the great scripts that deserve to be made.
